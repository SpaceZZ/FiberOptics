All fiber optic cables consist of three layers:
1. Core - An extremely thin single strand of glass or high quality plastic. This single
strand is layer that carries the data.
2. Cladding - Another layer of glass with a slightly different index of refraction from
the core. This slight difference can either allow light energy out from the core or
keep the majority of energy within the core (via reflections).
3. Jacket - Usually the last outer layer of plastic intended to protect the core and the
cladding. The composition of this layer greatly depends on the intended installation
environment.
